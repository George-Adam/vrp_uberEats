This requires Dunko`s VRP v6.7.

A UBER Eats job where you pick food from a fast food/restaurant and deliver it to a location on the map.

To add it to your server, move it to your resources folder then add 'ensure vrp_uberEats' in your server.cfg.

If you have any questions or issues, create an issue and I`ll answer back ASAP.
